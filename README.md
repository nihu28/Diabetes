Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the PIMA Diabetes dataset to build a machine learning model for predicting whether a person has diabetes based on various medical factors. The dataset includes features such as pregnancy count, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more.

Requirements:-
To run the code in this repository, you need to install the following Python libraries:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn

Dataset:-
The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical information about patients, including whether they have diabetes. It is stored as a CSV file (diabetes.csv).

You can download the dataset from Kaggle's Diabetes Dataset.
