# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and demographic factors. The project is built using the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset** and explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification.

## Features 🚀✨
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes the data and handles missing values.
- **Model Training**: Trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's accuracy and provides performance metrics.

## Prerequisites 🛠️📚
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
